# Accessing the Streamlit Dashboard

This project ships with a Streamlit dashboard that can run locally or be hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Download the Latest Processed Data

Each run of the **Nightly Data Pipeline** workflow archives a `processed-data` artifact. To download it:

1. Go to the [Actions](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Nightly+Data+Pipeline%22) tab in your repository.
2. Select the desired workflow run.
3. Under **Artifacts**, download **processed-data**.
4. Extract the archive and copy its contents into `data/processed/` in your local checkout.

## Run the Dashboard Locally

After copying the processed data, you can launch the dashboard:

```bash
flsd-dashboard
```

The interface will be available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Optional: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

If you want to share the dashboard publicly, you can deploy it on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud):

1. Sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click **New app** and choose this repository and the `src/dashboard.py` entry point.
3. Set the Python version to match `requirements.txt` (e.g., 3.10).
4. Deploy. Streamlit Cloud will automatically run `flsd-dashboard`.

Once deployed, share the URL generated by Streamlit Cloud with your users.
