Consolidated Analysis and Document Recommendations
Expenditure Overview
Based on the November 2023 Five-Year Financial Forecast and 2022-2023 expenditure data:
Total Expenditures (FY 2024): $14.57M.

Breakdown:
Salaries: 55% (~$8.01M, 3% annual growth, 62.51 full-time teachers, 19:1 student-teacher ratio).

Benefits: 20% (~$2.91M, 5% annual growth, highest growth rate due to healthcare/retirement costs).

Purchased Services: 15% (~$2.19M, 3% annual growth, significant for optimization due to discretionary nature).

Supplies: 7% (~$1.02M, 3% annual growth).

Capital Outlay: 3% (~$0.44M, 0% growth, indicating minimal facility investment).

Financial Context:
Projected deficit: $1.09M by FY 2028, with fund balance dropping from $5.37M (2024) to $2.97M (2028, ~17% of expenditures, below recommended 20%).

Revenue: $14.67M (2024) to $15.77M (2028, 1.8% growth), driven by state funding (47.2%), local taxes (41.7%), and open enrollment ($1.2M).

Expenditure growth (3.7% annually) outpaces revenue, driven by Benefits and Purchased Services.

Purchased Services: Composition and Growth
Purchased Services ($2.19M, 15% of FY 2024 expenditures) is a key focus due to its 3% annual growth and discretionary nature, offering potential savings of $50K-$200K through optimization (e.g., vendor renegotiation). While specific line items are not detailed in the provided sources, typical Ohio school district categories and FLSD-specific insights (e.g., PowerSchool data breach, SaferOH tip line) suggest:
Likely Subcategories (hypothetical allocation, totaling $2.19M):
Utilities: ~$0.7M (32%, 4% growth, driven by inflation in electricity/gas).

Transportation: ~$0.6M (27%, 3% growth, tied to open enrollment student transport).

Technology Services: ~$0.5M (23%, 5% growth, e.g., PowerSchool licenses, device monitoring post-breach).

Professional Services: ~$0.3M (14%, 2% growth, e.g., legal, auditing).

Maintenance Contracts: ~$0.09M (4%, 1% growth, e.g., HVAC, custodial).

Growth Drivers:
Technology (5% growth) is a leading contributor, likely due to increased software costs (e.g., PowerSchool, cybersecurity upgrades).

Utilities and Transportation grow due to inflation and operational demands (e.g., fuel costs for 1,155 students, including open enrollment).

Professional Services and Maintenance are smaller but may rise with contract renewals or facility needs (low Capital Outlay suggests deferred maintenance).

Key Insights
Optimization Potential: Purchased Services’ discretionary nature makes it a prime target. Technology ($0.5M) and Transportation ($0.6M) offer the most savings potential (e.g., consolidating software licenses, renegotiating bus contracts).

Fixed Costs Limit Flexibility: Salaries and Benefits (75% of expenditures) are less adjustable, reinforcing Purchased Services as a focus.

Deferred Maintenance Risk: Low Capital Outlay (3%) may lead to future spikes in Maintenance Contracts if facilities deteriorate.

Open Enrollment Impact: $1.2M in revenue comes with costs (e.g., Transportation, Technology), partially offsetting benefits.

Recommended Documents for Further Context
To clarify Purchased Services line items and refine your analysis, request or review:
FLSD Cupp Report (District Profile Report):
Details: Breaks down Purchased Services into subcategories (e.g., utilities, vendor contracts) and includes over 50 financial variables.

Access: Request from Treasurer Heather Darnold (treasurer@fredschools.com) or check ODE’s financial portal (education.ohio.gov).

ODE District Payment Reports:
Details: Lists vendor-level expenditures for Purchased Services (e.g., PowerSchool, utility providers).

Access: Search “Fredericktown Local School District” on education.ohio.gov or submit a public records request.

FLSD Board Financial Statements:
Details: Monthly/quarterly reports may detail major contracts (e.g., SaferOH, transportation) or Purchased Services trends.

Access: Check www.fredericktownschools.com (Board of Education section) or contact Sonya Overholt at 117 Columbus Road, Fredericktown, OH 43019.

Comparable District Data:
Details: Compare FLSD’s Purchased Services to similar rural districts (~1,000 students) to identify outliers (e.g., high technology costs).

Access: ODE’s District Profile Reports or Ohio School Report Cards (reportcard.education.ohio.gov).

Next Steps for Analysis
Request Data: Email the treasurer for the Cupp Report or detailed expenditure breakdowns to confirm Purchased Services subcategories.

Refine Models: Use the Python/Plotly code provided earlier to analyze specific line items (e.g., Technology costs) once data is obtained.

Benchmarking: Compare FLSD’s 15% Purchased Services allocation to state averages (typically 10-15%) to highlight inefficiencies.
